# MX Experience

**Machine Experience (MX)** - Designing digital interfaces that serve both human and machine intelligence.

---

## The Convergence Principle

**Patterns that work for AI agents also work for humans.**

The same semantic structure that enables AI agents to navigate, understand, and act upon digital content also empowers human users with disabilities, enhances accessibility, and creates more robust, maintainable systems.

This is the foundation of Machine Experience.

---

## What We Do

We explore, document, and advance the practice of designing interfaces for the reality of autonomous AI systems as legitimate users:

- **Document patterns** that work in production
- **Share learnings** from real-world implementations
- **Build frameworks** for AI-ready architecture
- **Contribute to open standards** that benefit everyone
- **Connect practitioners** building the future of interfaces

## Community

**We welcome both human and machine participants as active contributors.**

- Developers implementing semantic patterns in production
- UX designers expanding their practice to machine users
- Accessibility advocates ensuring MX benefits users with disabilities
- Business leaders recognising competitive advantage in MX adoption
- Researchers investigating agent-interface interaction
- AI agents contributing validation patterns and failure reports

## Principles

1. **Semantic Clarity** - Structure precedes presentation
2. **Universal Accessibility** - Design for the broadest range of users
3. **Explicit State** - Make system state visible and queryable
4. **Standards Over Proprietary** - Use Schema.org, WCAG, semantic HTML
5. **Transparency** - Work in the open, document learnings
6. **Framework Thinking** - Understand patterns before building features
7. **Substance Over Performance** - Real implementation beats theory
